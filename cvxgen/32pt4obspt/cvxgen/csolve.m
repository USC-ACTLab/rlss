% csolve  Solves a custom quadratic program very rapidly.
%
% [vars, status] = csolve(params, settings)
%
% solves the convex optimization problem
%
%   minimize(quad_form(w, H))
%   subject to
%     A*w <= -1
%
% with variables
%        w   3 x 1
%
% and parameters
%        A  36 x 3
%        H   3 x 3    PSD, diagonal
%
% Note:
%   - Check status.converged, which will be 1 if optimization succeeded.
%   - You don't have to specify settings if you don't want to.
%   - To hide output, use settings.verbose = 0.
%   - To change iterations, use settings.max_iters = 20.
%   - You may wish to compare with cvxsolve to check the solver is correct.
%
% Specify params.A, ..., params.H, then run
%   [vars, status] = csolve(params, settings)
